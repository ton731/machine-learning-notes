## YAML Configuration

### Each configuration file has 3 parts
1. metadata
2. specification
3. status (automatically generated by kubernetes)
    - `kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml`
    - `kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml > examples/nginx-deployment-result.yaml`

### Format of the configuration file
- syntax: strict indentation
- store the config file with your code or has own git repo for the config files

### Blue prints for pod
- Template: 
    - has it's own metadata and spec section
    - applies to pod
    - blue print of the pod

### Connecting components
Metadata contains labels, and the spec part contains selectors
- Labels
    - Pods get the label through the template blueprint
    - The label is matched by the selector to create the connection. So in this way, the deployment knows which pods belong to which deployment
- Selectors
    - The labels in metadata in deployment is for the service
    - The service will use selector to find the according pods with the same label
- Ports
    - In the service, `port` is for letting other apps to find him
    - Once the service is found, it will use `targetPort` to connect to its deployment app
